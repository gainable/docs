title: "Gainable vs Appsmith"
description: "Compare Gainable and Appsmith for building internal tools. See how AI-powered app generation compares to open-source low-code development."
---

## Quick verdict

Appsmith is an open-source low-code platform where developers connect databases, write queries, and drag widgets onto a canvas. Gainable removes the developer requirement entirely — describe what you need in plain English and get a working app with zero code, zero DevOps, and zero query writing.

If you have developers who want full control and prefer self-hosting, Appsmith gives you that flexibility. If you want anyone on the team to build production-ready tools without writing a line of code or managing infrastructure, Gainable is purpose-built for that.

<Tip>
**Bottom line:** Appsmith is open-source low-code for developers. Gainable is natural language app building for everyone.

## Side-by-side comparison

| Feature | Gainable | Appsmith |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Build method** | Natural language — describe what you want | Drag-and-drop canvas + JavaScript + SQL |
| **Technical skill required** | None | Developer-level (SQL, JavaScript, APIs) |
| **Hosting** | Fully managed, zero DevOps | Self-hosted (you manage servers, updates, security) |
| **Debugging** | Validation Agent catches issues before delivery | Manual — broken queries, widget misconfiguration |
| **Data connections** | Intelligent agent normalizes multi-source data | Manual query writing per data source |
| **Component approach** | Production-tested composable components (Weavy, Kanban, Charts) | Pixel-by-pixel widget dragging |
| **Codebase size** | Up to 90% smaller via composable architecture | Grows with every widget and query |
| **Collaboration** | Built-in chat, comments, file sharing, AI copilot | No native collaboration in apps |
| **RAG agents** | Full RAG agents connected to live data with composable copilot UI | No AI agent capabilities |
| **Pricing model** | Per builder — unlimited end users | Free tier + Business plan charges per user |

## Where Appsmith shines

<Accordion title="Appsmith's strengths">
- **Open-source option** — Community edition is free and self-hostable, giving you full control over your data and infrastructure.
- **Self-hosting control** — Run on your own servers with your own security policies, which matters for strict compliance environments.
- **Large community and plugins** — Active open-source community with a growing ecosystem of integrations and custom widgets.
</Accordion>

## Key differences that matter

### No developers needed

Appsmith's getting-started guide begins with connecting a database, writing SQL queries, and configuring JavaScript bindings. It's low-code, not no-code — you still need developers.

Gainable starts with "describe what you want." The [AI agent system](/concepts/how-it-works) handles data modeling, UI generation, query logic, and component wiring. Your operations lead can build the same tool that would take a developer days in Appsmith.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Managed platform, zero DevOps

Self-hosting Appsmith means managing servers, handling updates, applying security patches, configuring backups, and monitoring uptime. That's ongoing engineering overhead.

Gainable is fully managed. No servers, no updates, no patches, no infrastructure decisions. You build apps — Gainable handles everything else.

### Composable architecture vs pixel-by-pixel widgets

Appsmith apps are built by dragging widgets one at a time and wiring each to queries and transformers. The codebase grows with every component.

Gainable uses production-tested composable components. Ask for chat and you get a full [Weavy chat component](/building/collaboration). Ask for a kanban board and you get a complete [Kanban component](/skills/kanban). Ask for charts and you get [Chart.js visualizations](/skills/chartjs). Your codebase stays up to 90% smaller because you're composing proven components, not assembling widgets from scratch.

### RAG agents with composable copilot UI

Appsmith has no AI agent capabilities. If you want an intelligent assistant in your app, you're building it from scratch — connecting LLM APIs, managing context windows, writing retrieval logic, and building chat UI.

Gainable lets you create full [RAG agents](/agents/overview) that connect directly to your live, unified business data in real time. Your team can ask the copilot natural-language questions — "show me overdue tasks assigned to the west region" — and get answers drawn from your actual app data. The [composable copilot UI](/agents/copilot) is powered by Weavy, giving you a production-tested chat interface embedded right in your app.

### Same pricing advantage

Appsmith Business charges per user. As adoption grows across your organization, costs scale with every person who logs in.

Gainable charges per builder only. Deploy to your entire team — only the people creating apps need a subscription.

<Info>
Build tools for your whole organization without worrying about per-seat costs growing as more people use what you build.
</Info>

## Pricing

Appsmith offers a free community tier (self-hosted only), but the Business plan charges per user and adds up quickly for teams with broad adoption.

Gainable charges a flat rate per builder with unlimited end users and unlimited app builds. No infrastructure costs, no per-seat fees, no usage meters.

<Info>
With Gainable, you skip both the hosting costs and the per-user fees. One flat rate covers everything.
