title: "Gainable vs Retool"
description: "Compare Gainable and Retool for building internal tools. See how natural-language app generation compares to drag-and-drop development."
---

## Quick verdict

Retool is a powerful platform built for developers who want to assemble internal tools from pre-built components, SQL queries, and JavaScript. Gainable removes the developer requirement entirely — you describe what you need in plain English and get a working app with zero code, zero debugging, and zero query writing.

If your team has developers who enjoy wiring up components and writing SQL, Retool is a capable choice. If you want anyone on the team to build production-ready tools without touching code, Gainable is built for that.

<Tip>
**Bottom line:** Retool is drag-and-drop for developers. Gainable is natural language for everyone.
</Tip>

## Side-by-side comparison

| Feature | Gainable | Retool |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Build method** | Natural language — describe what you want | Drag-and-drop canvas + JavaScript + SQL |
| **Technical skill required** | None | Developer-level (SQL, JavaScript, APIs) |
| **Debugging** | Validation Agent catches issues before delivery | Manual — broken queries, misconfigured components |
| **Data connections** | Intelligent agent normalizes multi-source data automatically | Manual query writing per data source |
| **Database** | Flexible MongoDB (schema changes without migrations) | SQL-based (requires migrations for schema changes) |
| **Collaboration** | Built-in chat, comments, file sharing, AI copilot | Limited — no native team collaboration in apps |
| **RAG agents** | Full RAG agents connected to live data with composable copilot UI | Retool AI (separate add-on, no real-time data RAG) |
| **Pricing model** | Per builder — unlimited end users | Per end-user — costs scale with adoption |
| **Hosting** | Fully managed, zero DevOps | Cloud or self-hosted (self-hosted requires maintenance) |
| **Iteration speed** | Describe changes in plain English | Reconfigure components, rewrite queries |

## Where Retool shines

<Accordion title="Retool's strengths">
- **Mature ecosystem** — Years of development with hundreds of integrations, a large component library, and extensive documentation.
- **SQL query builder** — If your team thinks in SQL, Retool's query editor is excellent for writing and testing complex database queries.
- **Developer control** — Granular control over every component property, event handler, and data transformation when you need pixel-perfect customization.
</Accordion>

## Key differences that matter

### Natural language vs drag-and-drop

Retool's canvas gives developers fine-grained control — but that control comes with complexity. You drag widgets, wire up event handlers, write SQL queries, and add JavaScript transformers. Every connection is manual.

Gainable replaces the entire workflow with a single prompt. Describe your app, and the [AI agent system](/concepts/how-it-works) handles data modeling, UI generation, and component wiring automatically.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Zero debugging vs manual troubleshooting

Retool apps break when queries return unexpected data, components are misconfigured, or JavaScript transformers have edge cases. Debugging is on you.

Gainable's [Validation Agent](/concepts/agents) catches issues before your app is delivered. Deterministic boilerplate with Locality of Behavior means generated code is predictable and correct — not something you need to audit and fix.

### Pricing that scales with builders, not users

Retool charges per end-user. Build a tool for your 50-person operations team and you're paying for all 50 seats. Grow to 500 users and your bill grows 10x.

Gainable charges per builder only. Deploy your app to 50 or 5,000 end users — the price stays the same.

<Info>
Gainable's flat-rate pricing means you never have to think twice about giving more people access to the tools they need.
</Info>

### RAG agents on your live data

Retool recently added AI features, but they're bolt-on — separate from your data layer and limited in what they can access in real time.

Gainable lets you build full [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agents](/agents/overview) that connect directly to your live, unified business data. Ask your copilot "which deals are at risk this quarter?" and it queries your actual pipeline data in real time. The [composable copilot UI](/agents/copilot) — powered by Weavy — embeds directly into your app as a production-tested chat interface, not a bolted-on widget.

</CardGroup>

### Flexible data without migrations

Retool sits on SQL. Adding a field means writing a migration, updating queries, and testing that nothing breaks downstream.

Gainable uses MongoDB with an [intelligent data agent](/building/data-connectors) that normalizes data from multiple sources into a clean, consumable model. Schema changes happen naturally — no migrations, no breakage.

## Pricing

Retool's per-user pricing means costs grow with every person who uses your tools. For teams building tools used across the organization, this adds up fast.

Gainable charges a flat rate per builder with unlimited end users and unlimited app builds. No usage meters, no per-seat surprises.

<Info>
Build for your entire company without worrying about per-seat costs. Only the people creating apps need a Gainable subscription.
