title: "Gainable vs Structify"
description: "Compare Gainable and Structify for working with business data. See how full app generation on unified data compares to data collection and dashboards."
---

## Quick verdict

Dashboards tell you what happened. Apps let you do something about it. Structify focuses on collecting and structuring data into dashboards and visualizations. Gainable does the same data unification — then goes further, building full production-ready apps with forms, workflows, kanban boards, collaboration, and AI assistants on top of that unified data.

If you only need to visualize structured data, Structify does that well. If you need to act on your data — manage workflows, collaborate with your team, and build real tools — Gainable bridges the gap from data to action.

<Tip>
**Bottom line:** Structify stops at dashboards. Gainable goes from scattered data to full working apps.

## Side-by-side comparison

| Feature | Gainable | Structify |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Primary output** | Full working apps (forms, workflows, dashboards, collaboration) | Dashboards and structured data |
| **Data collection** | Intelligent agent normalizes multi-source data | AI-powered data discovery and structuring |
| **Build method** | Natural language — describe what you want | Configure data sources and dashboard views |
| **Forms & input** | Full CRUD — create, read, update, delete records | Read-only — view and analyze data |
| **Workflow tools** | Kanban boards, approval flows, process trackers | Not available |
| **Collaboration** | Built-in chat, comments, file sharing, AI copilot | Not available |
| **RAG agents** | Full RAG agents on live data with composable copilot UI | Not available |
| **Charts & visualization** | Full Chart.js integration | Dashboard visualizations |
| **Extensibility** | Iteratively add features and views via natural language | Dashboard is the end product |
| **Pricing model** | Per builder — unlimited end users | Usage-based |

## Where Structify shines

<Accordion title="Structify's strengths">
- **Data collection focus** — Purpose-built for discovering, collecting, and structuring data from diverse sources. Data extraction is the core competency.
- **Unstructured data handling** — Effective at discovering structure in unstructured or semi-structured data sources and making it queryable.
</Accordion>

## Key differences that matter

### From data to action

Structify collects data and displays it in dashboards. The dashboard is the end product. You can see what's happening, but to act on it you need separate tools.

Gainable builds full working applications on unified data. See a deal that needs attention? Update it directly. Need to assign a task? Do it in the app. Want to discuss a data point with your team? Use the built-in chat. The gap between insight and action disappears.

### Same data intelligence, plus everything else

Gainable's [intelligent data agent](/building/data-connectors) normalizes multi-source data just like Structify — connecting to CRMs, spreadsheets, payment systems, and other sources, then unifying that data into a clean, consumable model.

The difference is what happens next. Gainable builds the full application stack on top of that unified data: [views and dashboards](/building/views), kanban boards, forms, detail pages, [team collaboration](/building/collaboration), and [AI copilot assistants](/agents/copilot).

### Full application stack

Structify gives you charts and data views. Gainable gives you:

- **Charts and dashboards** — [Chart.js visualizations](/skills/chartjs) on your unified data
- **Kanban boards** — [Drag-and-drop workflow management](/skills/kanban)
- **Forms and detail views** — Full CRUD operations on your data
- **File sharing** — Upload and manage documents in context
- **Team chat** — Real-time [collaboration](/building/collaboration) right in the app
- **RAG agents** — Full [retrieval-augmented generation agents](/agents/overview) connected to your live unified data in real time
- **Composable copilot UI** — Production-tested [AI copilot interface](/agents/copilot) powered by Weavy, embedded directly in your apps
- **Custom AI agents** — Build [domain-specific AI](/agents/creating-agents) that answers questions, analyzes data, and guides users

### RAG agents on your unified data

Structify structures data. That's where it ends. If you want to ask intelligent questions about that data, you need a separate tool.

Gainable builds full [RAG agents](/agents/overview) directly on your unified data. Your team can ask "which accounts haven't been contacted in 30 days?" or "summarize this quarter's revenue trend" and the copilot queries your live data in real time. The [composable copilot UI](/agents/copilot) — powered by Weavy — gives you a production-tested chat interface embedded right in the app. No separate BI tool, no separate AI tool.

This is what bridges data to action: unified data + full apps + RAG agents that make your data conversational.

### Composable and extensible

With Structify, the dashboard is the end product. Want a different view? Build another dashboard.

With Gainable, your app grows with your needs. Start with a dashboard, then add a kanban board for task management. Add team chat for collaboration. Build a [RAG agent](/agents/overview) that answers questions about the data in real time. Every iteration is a natural-language prompt away — your unified data powers all of it.

<Info>
Gainable's composable architecture means your app evolves as your needs evolve. Every new feature builds on the same intelligently unified data.
</Info>

## Pricing

Structify's pricing is based on data processing usage. Costs vary depending on the volume and complexity of data you're structuring.

Gainable charges a flat rate per builder with unlimited end users and unlimited app builds. Your data unification, app generation, and team access are all included.

<Info>
One flat rate covers data unification, app generation, collaboration features, AI agents, and unlimited end users.
