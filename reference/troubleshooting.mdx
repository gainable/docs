## Common issues

### Build didn't create what I expected

**Problem:** The app looks different from what you described.

**Solutions:**
1. **Be more specific** - Add detail to your prompt
2. **Break it down** - Build in smaller steps
3. **Clarify fields** - List exact field names and types

<Accordion title="Example: Before and after">
**Before (vague):**
```text
Make a CRM
```

**After (specific):**
```text
Build a CRM with:
- Companies (name, industry, size)
- Contacts (name, email, phone, linked to company)
- Deals (name, amount, status, linked to company)
- Dashboard with deal totals
```
</Accordion>

### Data isn't saving

**Problem:** You fill out a form but the data disappears.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check required fields** - Make sure all required fields are filled
2. **Describe the issue** - Tell Gainable: "The deal form isn't saving. The data disappears after I click save."
3. **Reload and retry** - Refresh the page and try again

### Changes not appearing for other users

**Problem:** Real-time updates aren't working.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check internet connection** - Ensure you're online
2. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes connections need to reconnect
3. **Same view?** - Make sure other users are viewing the same page

### Chart showing wrong data

**Problem:** The chart doesn't match your expectations.

**Solutions:**
1. **Specify the grouping** - "Group by status" vs "group by month"
2. **Name the date field** - "Use close date for the timeline"
3. **Request a change** - "The chart should show deals by status, not by company"

<Accordion title="Example: Fixing a chart">
```text
The deals by status pie chart is showing the wrong data.
It should group deals by their status field (new, won, lost)
and show the count in each status.
```
</Accordion>

### Kanban cards not dragging

**Problem:** Cards won't move between columns.

**Solutions:**
1. **Refresh the page** - Reload to reinitialize
2. **Check console** - Open browser dev tools for error messages
3. **Report the issue** - "Cards on the kanban board aren't dragging"

### Filter not working

**Problem:** Filter selections don't change the displayed data.

**Solutions:**
1. **Clear and reselect** - Reset the filter and try again
2. **Check the field** - Make sure items have values in the filtered field
3. **Describe the issue** - "The status filter on the deals page isn't filtering"

## Requesting fixes

When something isn't working right, help Gainable understand by being specific:

### Be specific about what's wrong

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
"The deal amount is showing without a dollar sign.
It should display as currency like $50,000"
```

```text Vague
"The amounts look wrong"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Describe what you expected

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
"The chart should show deals grouped by status (won, lost, pending),
but it's grouping by company instead."
```

```text Vague
"The chart is broken"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Provide context

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
"On the deals page, when I click Add Deal and submit the form,
the deal doesn't appear in the list. I have to refresh the page
to see it."
```

```text Vague
"Adding doesn't work"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Getting help

### Describe the issue clearly

Include:
- **What you were trying to do**
- **What happened instead**
- **Any error messages you saw**
- **Steps to reproduce**

### Example help request

```text
Issue: New tasks aren't showing on the kanban board

Steps:
1. Click "Add Task" button
2. Fill out the form (title: "Test task", status: "To Do")
3. Click Save
4. Form closes but task doesn't appear in "To Do" column
5. After refreshing the page, the task appears

Expected: Task should appear immediately after saving
```

## Browser issues

### Clear cache and cookies

Sometimes browser data causes issues:

1. Open browser settings
2. Find "Clear browsing data"
3. Select "Cookies" and "Cached images/files"
4. Clear for the Gainable site

### Try a different browser

If issues persist, try:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Disable extensions

Browser extensions can interfere. Try:
1. Disable ad blockers temporarily
2. Disable other extensions
3. Try incognito/private mode

## Performance issues

### Slow loading

If your app feels slow:

1. **Check your data volume** - Very large datasets may load slowly
2. **Add pagination** - "Paginate the deals list with 25 items per page"
3. **Add filters** - Filter to show fewer items at once

### Charts loading slowly

For charts with lots of data:

1. **Limit the data** - "Show last 12 months only"
2. **Aggregate** - "Group by month instead of by day"
3. **Simplify** - Reduce the number of charts on one page

## Still stuck?

If you've tried the above and still have issues:

1. **Describe the problem in detail** in the chat
2. **Include any error messages** you see
3. **Share what you've already tried**

Gainable will help diagnose and fix the issue.
