## The agent system

Gainable uses multiple specialized AI agents, each with a specific role in building your application. Think of them as a team of experts working together.

## Planner Agent

The Planner is the first agent to see your request. It analyzes what you want and creates a structured plan.

<Card title="What the Planner does" icon="clipboard-list">
- Understands your intent (create, update, or seed data)
- Identifies what data models you need
- Determines which views and features to build
- Recognizes when to use built-in skills (charts, kanban, chat)
- Creates a checklist of what will be delivered
</Card>

### Example: Planner in action

When you say: *"Build a project tracker with tasks and due dates"*

The Planner creates:

```
Intent: Create new application

Summary: Build project tracker with task management

Data models needed:
- Project (name, description, status)
- Task (title, due date, priority, linked to project)

Views:
- Project list with task counts
- Task management within each project

Features:
- Create/edit/delete projects
- Add tasks with due dates
- Filter tasks by status
```

This plan is then handed to the Build Agent.

## Build Agent

The Build Agent is the workhorse that generates all your application code.

<Card title="What the Build Agent does" icon="hammer">
- Creates database models to store your data
- Builds API routes for data operations
- Generates user interface pages
- Implements forms, tables, and interactive elements
- Follows proven patterns for reliability
</Card>

### Skills and expertise

The Build Agent has deep knowledge of:

- **Data visualization** - Charts, graphs, KPIs
- **Drag-and-drop** - Kanban boards, sortable lists
- **Real-time updates** - Live data synchronization
- **UI patterns** - Forms, modals, drawers, navigation
- **Collaboration** - Chat, files, comments integration

<Tip>
When you request a specific feature like "add a chart" or "add a kanban board", the Build Agent uses specialized knowledge to implement it correctly.
</Tip>

## Validation Agent

Before your app is delivered, the Validation Agent checks for common issues.

<Card title="What Validation catches" icon="shield-check">
- Forms that don't save data correctly
- Missing connections between data and views
- UI patterns that could break on mobile
- Common coding mistakes
</Card>

This happens automatically - you don't need to do anything. It's like having a quality assurance team review the code before you see it.

## Conversation Agent

When you ask questions about your project (instead of requesting changes), the Conversation Agent helps.

<Card title="What the Conversation Agent does" icon="comments">
- Answers questions about what was built
- Explains how features work
- Helps troubleshoot issues
- Provides guidance on next steps
</Card>

### Example: Asking questions

<CodeGroup>
```text Your question
"How does the task filtering work?"
```

```text Conversation Agent response
"Tasks can be filtered by status using the dropdown menu
at the top of the task list. The filter is applied
client-side, so it updates instantly as you select
different options. The available statuses are:
pending, in progress, and completed."
```
</CodeGroup>

## How agents communicate

The agents work in sequence, each building on the previous work:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your prompt arrives">
    You describe what you want to build or change
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intent classification">
    The system determines: build, question, or seed data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Planner creates the plan">
    For build requests, the Planner analyzes and structures the work
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Agent executes">
    Code is generated following the plan
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation reviews">
    Generated code is checked for issues
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivery">
    Your working app appears in the preview
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Context preservation

All agents share context about your project:

- **What's already built** - Existing models, views, and features
- **Your preferences** - Design choices, naming conventions
- **Project history** - Previous changes and iterations

This means you can say things like "add a filter to the deals page" and the agents understand exactly which page you mean.

<Note>
Context is preserved throughout your session. Each new request builds on everything that came before.
</Note>

## Best practices

To get the most from the agent system:

1. **Be specific** - The more detail you provide, the better the results
2. **One thing at a time** - Let each build complete before requesting the next
3. **Use natural language** - Write like you're explaining to a colleague
4. **Request by feature name** - "Add a pie chart" is clearer than "visualize this somehow"
