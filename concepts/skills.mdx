## What are skills?

Skills are pre-built capabilities that Gainable can add to your applications. When you request a skill by name, the Build Agent uses specialized knowledge to implement it correctly.

<Tip>
You don't need to know how these work internally. Just request them by name in your prompts, and Gainable handles the implementation.
