## From idea to app

When you describe what you want to build, Gainable uses specialized AI agents that work together to create your application. Here's what happens behind the scenes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You describe your app">
    Write what you want in plain English. Be as specific or general as you like.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Planner Agent analyzes your request">
    The Planner understands your intent, identifies what data you need, and creates a structured build plan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Agent generates code">
    The Build Agent creates your complete application: database models, user interface, and all the logic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation ensures quality">
    Before delivering your app, validation checks catch common issues and ensure everything works.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your app is ready">
    A fully functional application is ready to use immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What makes this different?

Unlike simple AI code generators, Gainable creates **complete, production-ready applications**:

| Traditional AI Code | Gainable |
|---------------------|----------|
| Generates code snippets | Generates complete apps |
| You assemble the pieces | Everything is connected |
| Basic text completion | Specialized agents with deep expertise |
| Generic output | Follows proven patterns |

## The agent system

Gainable uses multiple AI agents, each specialized for a specific task:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Planner Agent" icon="clipboard-list">
    Analyzes your request and creates a detailed build plan. Identifies data models, views, and features needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build Agent" icon="hammer">
    Generates the actual code for your application. Creates database models, routes, and user interfaces.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validation Agent" icon="shield-check">
    Checks generated code for common issues and ensures it follows best practices.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Conversation Agent" icon="comments">
    Answers questions about your project and helps you understand what was built.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What happens when you send a prompt

Let's follow a real example through the system:

<Accordion title="Example: 'Build a task tracker with due dates and priorities'">
**1. Planner Agent receives your request**

The Planner identifies:
- You need a Task data model
- Fields: title, description, due date, priority
- You'll need a view to manage tasks
- CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)

**2. Plan is created**

```
Summary: Build task tracker with due dates and priority levels

Features:
- Task management (add, edit, delete tasks)
- Due date tracking
- Priority levels (low, medium, high)
- Task list view

Data model:
- Task: title, description, dueDate, priority, completed
```

**3. Build Agent generates code**

The Build Agent creates:
- Database model for Task
- API routes for CRUD operations
- A task list view with forms
- Priority badges and date formatting

**4. Validation runs**

Checks ensure:
- All fields are properly connected
- Forms save data correctly
- The interface works on mobile

**5. Your app is ready**

You now have a working task tracker you can use immediately.
</Accordion>

## How iteration works

Gainable remembers everything about your project. When you ask for changes:

1. **Context is preserved** - The AI knows what's already built
2. **Existing features are protected** - New additions don't break what works
3. **Changes are targeted** - Only the relevant parts are modified

<Tip>
This means you can build incrementally. Start with something simple, then add features one at a time. Each change builds on what came before.
</Tip>

## Technical foundation

Every Gainable app is built on a proven tech stack:

| Layer | Technology | What it does |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Database** | MongoDB | Stores all your data flexibly |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express | Handles data operations |
| **Frontend** | Modern HTML/CSS/JS | Beautiful, responsive interface |
| **Real-time** | Socket.IO | Instant updates across users |
| **UI Components** | DaisyUI + Tailwind | Polished, themeable design |
| **Collaboration** | Weavy | Chat, files, and comments |

<Note>
You don't need to know any of these technologies to use Gainable. This is just what powers your apps behind the scenes.
