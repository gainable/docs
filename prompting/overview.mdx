## The art of prompting

Gainable understands natural language, but how you describe things affects what you get. This guide will help you write prompts that produce exactly what you want.

## The golden rule

<Note>
**Be specific about your data, clear about relationships, and explicit about features.**

The more specific your prompt, the more accurate your app.
</Note>

## Five key principles

### 1. Name your fields explicitly

Tell Gainable exactly what data you want to track.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Build a contact manager with:
- Name, email, phone number
- Company they work for
- Job title
- Last contacted date
```

```text Vague
Build something to track contacts
```
</CodeGroup>

Why this matters: When you name fields, Gainable creates exactly those fields. When you're vague, it has to guess.

### 2. Describe relationships

If data is connected, say how.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Build a CRM where:
- Companies have a name, industry, and size
- Contacts belong to a company
- Deals are linked to both a company and a contact
```

```text Missing relationships
Track companies, contacts, and deals
```
</CodeGroup>

Common relationship patterns:
- "X belongs to Y" - Each X is linked to one Y
- "X has many Y" - One X can have multiple Y items
- "X and Y are linked" - They reference each other

### 3. Describe the user journey

Explain how people will actually use the app.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Users should be able to:
1. Create a new project
2. Add tasks to that project
3. Assign tasks to team members
4. Mark tasks as complete
5. See a progress dashboard
```

```text Unclear
Make a project tracker
```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Request features by name

Use specific feature names when you know what you want.

| Instead of... | Say... |
|--------------|--------|
| "Show the data graphically" | "Add a pie chart showing deals by status" |
| "Make it organized" | "Add a kanban board with columns" |
| "Let people talk" | "Add a team chat" |
| "Make it sortable" | "Let me drag to reorder items" |

### 5. Iterate incrementally

Build your app step by step instead of all at once.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with the basics">
    "Build a task tracker with title, description, and status"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add more fields">
    "Add due date and priority to tasks"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add visualization">
    "Add a dashboard with a chart showing tasks by status"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add advanced features">
    "Add a kanban board view"
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Incremental building is more reliable than trying to specify everything upfront. Each step is smaller and easier for Gainable to get right.
</Tip>

## Prompt structure

A well-structured prompt typically has three parts:

### 1. What you're building (the entity)

```text
Build a [thing] tracker...
Create a [thing] management system...
I need to track [things]...
```

### 2. What data it stores (the fields)

```text
...with [field 1], [field 2], and [field 3]
...including name, status, and due date
...that has title, description, priority, and assignee
```

### 3. What you can do with it (the features)

```text
...and a dashboard showing totals
...with a kanban board for status
...where I can filter by date
```

## Complete example

Here's a well-structured prompt that combines all principles:

```text
Build a customer support ticket system where:

Tickets have:
- Title and description
- Priority (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Status (new, in progress, resolved, closed)
- Customer email
- Assigned agent
- Created date

I should be able to:
- Create new tickets
- Assign tickets to agents
- Update ticket status
- Add comments to tickets

Show a dashboard with:
- Total open tickets count
- Tickets by priority (pie chart)
- Tickets by status (bar chart)
- Recent tickets list

Use a kanban board for the main ticket view, organized by status.
```

This prompt is specific about data, clear about features, and describes the user journey.

## What to avoid

<Warning>
These patterns lead to unpredictable results:
</Warning>

| Don't | Do instead |
|-------|------------|
| "Make me a CRM" | "Track deals with company, amount, status, and close date" |
| "Add some charts" | "Add a pie chart showing deals by status" |
| "Make it pretty" | "Use the cupcake theme" |
| "Like Salesforce" | Describe the specific features you need |
| Everything in one prompt | Build incrementally |
