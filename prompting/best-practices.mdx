## Do this

### Be specific about data fields

<CodeGroup>
```text Do this
Track contacts with:
- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Company name
- Job title
- LinkedIn profile URL
```

```text Don't do this
Track contact information
```
</CodeGroup>

### Specify field types when it matters

<CodeGroup>
```text Do this
Track deals with:
- Deal name (text)
- Amount (currency)
- Close date (date)
- Probability (percentage)
- Status (new, negotiating, won, lost)
```

```text Don't do this
Track deals with name, amount, date, probability, status
```
</CodeGroup>

Common field types to specify:
- **Currency**: "amount (currency)" or "price in dollars"
- **Date**: "due date" or "close date"
- **Percentage**: "probability (percentage)"
- **Options**: "status (option A, option B, option C)"
- **Yes/No**: "is active (yes/no)" or "completed (checkbox)"

### Describe relationships clearly

<CodeGroup>
```text Do this
Build a project system where:
- Projects have a name and description
- Each project has multiple tasks
- Tasks have a title, due date, and status
- Each task is assigned to one user
```

```text Don't do this
Track projects, tasks, and users
```
</CodeGroup>

### Request specific visualizations

<CodeGroup>
```text Do this
Add a dashboard with:
- Total revenue card
- Number of deals card
- Pie chart showing deals by status
- Line chart showing monthly revenue trend
```

```text Don't do this
Add a dashboard with some charts
```
</CodeGroup>

### Define options explicitly

<CodeGroup>
```text Do this
Status options: draft, pending review, approved, rejected
Priority levels: low, medium, high, critical
```

```text Don't do this
Add status and priority fields
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Don't do this

### Don't reference other products

<CodeGroup>
```text Don't do this
Build something like Asana
Make it work like Notion
Copy the Salesforce pipeline
```

```text Do this instead
Build a task manager with:
- Projects containing tasks
- Tasks with title, assignee, due date, status
- Kanban board view
- List view with filters
```
</CodeGroup>

Why: Gainable doesn't know what features you want from those products. Describe the specific features you need.

### Don't use vague design terms

<CodeGroup>
```text Don't do this
Make it modern
Keep it clean
Professional looking
```

```text Do this instead
Use the corporate theme
Use blue and gray colors
Use a sidebar navigation layout
```
</CodeGroup>

### Don't request everything at once

<CodeGroup>
```text Don't do this
Build a complete CRM with leads, contacts, companies,
deals, tasks, emails, calendar, reports, dashboards,
team management, permissions, notifications, and
mobile app with offline support.
```

```text Do this instead
Build a deal tracker with:
- Deals (name, amount, status, close date)
- Contacts (name, email, linked to deal)
- Dashboard with deal totals

(Then add more features in subsequent prompts)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Don't assume Gainable knows your domain

<CodeGroup>
```text Don't do this
Build a standard e-commerce checkout flow
Add the usual project management features
```

```text Do this instead
Build checkout with:
- Cart review step
- Shipping address form
- Payment method selection
- Order confirmation page
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Updating existing apps

When modifying an app you've already built:

### Reference existing elements

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Add a due date field to the Task model
```

```text Less clear
Add due dates
```
</CodeGroup>

### Specify where to make changes

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
On the deals page, add a filter dropdown for status
```

```text Ambiguous
Add filtering
```
</CodeGroup>

### Build on what exists

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Add a chart showing Tasks grouped by status
```

```text Creates confusion
Add a chart showing items by category
(What items? What category?)
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Asking questions vs requesting builds

Gainable can answer questions about your project without making changes.

### To ask a question

```text
How does the task filtering work?
What fields does the Deal model have?
Where is the dashboard code?
```

### To request a change

```text
Add a due date field to tasks
Change the dashboard to show monthly data
Fix the filter to include all statuses
```

<Tip>
Start questions with "how", "what", "where", or "explain" to get information without triggering a build.
</Tip>

---

## Recovery from mistakes

If something wasn't built correctly:

### Be specific about what's wrong

<CodeGroup>
```text Clear
The deal amount is showing without the dollar sign.
Format it as currency.
```

```text Vague
The amounts look wrong
```
</CodeGroup>

### Describe what you expected

<CodeGroup>
```text Clear
The chart should show deals grouped by status, but
it's showing them grouped by company. Change it to
group by status.
```

```text Vague
The chart is wrong
```
</CodeGroup>
