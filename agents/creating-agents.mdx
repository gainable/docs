## How agent creation works

When you describe the assistant you want, Gainable's **Agent Planner** analyzes your request and the **Agent Builder** creates the agent. The agent stays synced with your app — as you add data models or features, the agent can be updated to work with them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe your agent">
    Tell Gainable what kind of assistant you want, what it should know, and how it should behave.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Planner analyzes">
    The Agent Planner determines the agent's name, instructions, functions, and configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Builder creates">
    The Agent Builder sets up the agent with all its properties and connects it to your app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent stays synced">
    As your app changes, you can update the agent through follow-up prompts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name shown in the copilot header (e.g., "Sales Coach") |
| **Description** | Short summary of what the agent does, shown to users |
| **Instructions** | System prompt that defines the agent's behavior, tone, and rules |
| **Conversation starters** | Pre-defined prompts displayed as buttons to help users begin |
| **Web search** | Whether the agent can search the web for additional information |
| **Functions** | Connections to your app's API endpoints for reading and writing data |
| **Knowledge** | Uploaded documents the agent can reference when answering |

## Writing good prompts for agent creation

Be specific about what the agent should do, who it helps, and what data it needs access to.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good prompt
Create an AI agent called "Sales Coach" for our sales team.
It should:
- Help reps find deals by status, company, or amount
- Answer questions about our sales process
- Use a friendly, encouraging tone
- Start conversations with: "Show my open deals",
  "What deals are closing this month?",
  "Find deals over $10k"
- Have access to deals and contacts data
- Be able to search the web for company information
```

```text Vague prompt
Add an AI assistant to help with sales stuff.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Writing effective instructions

The agent's **instructions** act as its system prompt — they define how the agent behaves in every conversation. Good instructions include:

- **Role definition** — Who the agent is and what it specializes in
- **Tone and personality** — How it should communicate
- **Rules and boundaries** — What it should and shouldn't do
- **Data awareness** — What data it has access to

### Example instructions

```text
You are Sales Coach, a helpful AI assistant for the sales team.

Your role:
- Help reps find and analyze their deals
- Provide pipeline insights and status updates
- Suggest next steps based on deal stage

Tone:
- Friendly and encouraging
- Concise — prefer bullet points over long paragraphs
- Use data to back up suggestions

Rules:
- Always confirm before making changes to deals
- If you don't know something, say so
- Focus on deals and sales — redirect other questions
```

## Conversation starters

Conversation starters are pre-defined prompts displayed as clickable buttons when the copilot opens. They help users discover what the agent can do.

### Best practices

- **Keep them short** — 3-8 words per starter
- **Make them varied** — Cover different capabilities
- **Be domain-specific** — Match your agent's purpose
- **Use action language** — Start with verbs

<CodeGroup>
```text Good starters
"Show my open deals"
"Deals closing this month"
"Find deals over $10k"
"Pipeline summary"
```

```text Weak starters
"Help me"
"What can you do?"
"Tell me something"
"Hi"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Web search

Enabling web search lets the agent look up external information during conversations.

**When to enable:**
- The agent needs current information (news, market data, company details)
- Users might ask questions beyond your app data and documents

**When to skip:**
- The agent only works with internal data
- You want to keep responses focused on your content
- Sensitive contexts where external information could be misleading

## Managing and updating agents

You can update agents through follow-up prompts at any time:

```text
Update the Sales Coach agent to also greet users by name
and add a conversation starter for "Top deals this week"
```

```text
Change the support agent's tone to be more formal
and remove the web search capability
```

```text
Add a new conversation starter: "Check order status"
```

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about the domain">
    An agent that "helps with everything" is less useful than one focused on a specific area like sales, support, or HR.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Define tone and personality">
    Agents feel more natural when they have a consistent personality. Specify whether it should be formal, casual, encouraging, or direct.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mention data access explicitly">
    Tell the agent what data models it should use: "Give it access to deals and contacts" is much clearer than "let it see the data."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test with real questions">
    After creating an agent, try asking it the kinds of questions your users would ask. Refine instructions based on the results.
