## What are AI agents?

AI agents are custom assistants you create inside your Gainable apps. They can answer questions, look up data, perform actions, and guide users — all through a conversational chat interface called the **copilot**.

<Info>
**Build agents vs custom agents:** Gainable uses [build agents](/concepts/agents) (Planner, Build, Validation, Conversation) to *create* your app. The agents described here are different — they are custom AI assistants that live *inside* your finished app and help your users.
