## What are functions?

Functions are connections between your AI agent and your app's API endpoints. They let the agent read and write data — looking up records, filtering lists, creating entries, and performing actions on behalf of users.

<Info>
Functions are how agents interact with your app's live data. Without functions, an agent can only chat and reference knowledge base documents. With functions, it can answer questions like "Show me all deals closing this month" by actually querying your data.
</Info>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build your app with data models">
    Create your application with the data models and features you need. Each data model gets API endpoints automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe what the agent needs">
    When creating or updating your agent, describe what data it should access: "Give it access to deals and contacts data."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Builder discovers endpoints">
    The Agent Builder examines your app's API endpoints and creates functions that map to them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Functions are ready">
    The agent can now query, filter, and modify data through these functions during conversations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic endpoint discovery

When you ask the Agent Builder to give an agent access to your data, it automatically discovers your app's available API endpoints. You don't need to manually configure routes or write API code — the builder reads your app's data models and creates the appropriate function mappings.

This means the agent learns what data exists, what fields are available, and what operations are possible.

## Prompt examples

```text
Give the Sales Coach agent access to deals and contacts
so it can look up pipeline data and find contact information.
```

```text
Add functions to the support agent so it can look up
orders by order number and check order status.
```

```text
Let the HR assistant query employee records and
time-off requests.
```

<Warning>
Your app must be built with data models before you can add functions. The agent needs existing API endpoints to connect to. Build your app first, then create the agent and add functions.
</Warning>

## Query capabilities

Agents with functions can perform sophisticated data queries:

| Capability | Example question | What happens |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Filter** | "Show deals with status won" | Filters records by field value |
| **Sort** | "Show deals sorted by amount, highest first" | Orders results by a field |
| **Search** | "Find contacts at Acme Corp" | Searches text fields |
| **Date ranges** | "Deals closing this month" | Filters by date ranges |
| **Numeric ranges** | "Deals over $10,000" | Filters by numeric thresholds |
| **Limits** | "Show the top 5 deals" | Limits result count |
| **Combined filters** | "Open deals over $10k closing this quarter" | Applies multiple filters at once |

## Managing functions

You can add, update, or remove functions through prompts:

### Adding functions

```text
Give the Sales Coach access to the products data model
so it can answer questions about pricing.
```

### Updating function scope

```text
Update the support agent's functions to also include
access to the returns data.
```

### Removing functions

```text
Remove the Sales Coach's access to employee data —
it should only see deals and contacts.
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with read access">
    Begin by giving agents the ability to read and query data. Add write capabilities (creating or updating records) only when needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about which models">
    Instead of "give it access to everything," specify the data models: "Give it access to deals, contacts, and companies." This keeps the agent focused and reduces confusion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match functions to the agent's purpose">
    A sales agent needs deals and contacts. A support agent needs orders and tickets. Don't give agents access to data they don't need.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combine with knowledge bases">
    Functions handle live data queries. Knowledge bases handle static reference material. Together, an agent can look up a customer's order *and* reference your return policy to answer a question.
