## What is the copilot?

The copilot is an AI chat interface you can embed in any page of your Gainable app using the `<wy-copilot>` component. It connects to one of your [AI agents](/agents/creating-agents) and gives users a conversational way to interact with your app's data and knowledge.

<Info>
Each copilot is linked to a single agent. You can place multiple copilots on different pages, each connected to a different agent — for example, a sales assistant on the deals page and a support helper on the tickets page.
</Info>

## Adding a copilot

Describe where you want the copilot and which agent it should use:

```text
Add a copilot to the deals page connected to the Sales Coach agent.
```

```text
Put an AI chat panel on the support dashboard
using the Support Assistant agent.
```

```text
Add copilots to each main page:
- Deals page: Sales Coach agent
- Support page: Support Assistant agent
- HR page: HR Helper agent
```

## What users see

When a copilot is added to a page, users see:

- **Agent name and description** in the chat header
- **Conversation starters** as clickable buttons to begin a conversation
- **Message input** for typing questions
- **Chat responses** with formatted text, lists, and data from functions and knowledge

## Capabilities

The copilot inherits all capabilities from its connected agent:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Chat** | Natural language conversation |
| **Function calling** | Query and modify app data through the agent's functions |
| **Knowledge queries** | Reference uploaded documents from the agent's knowledge base |
| **Web search** | Search the web if enabled on the agent |
| **Conversation starters** | Pre-defined prompts shown as buttons |

## Placement patterns

### Specific page placement

Place a copilot on the page where it's most relevant:

```text
Add the Sales Coach copilot to the deals page.
```

### Multiple pages, same agent

Use the same agent on several pages:

```text
Add the Support Assistant copilot to both the
tickets page and the customer detail page.
```

### Different agents per page

Match the agent to the page context:

```text
Add copilots:
- Deals page → Sales Coach agent
- Tickets page → Support Assistant agent
- Dashboard → Analytics Helper agent
```

## Copilot vs team chat

The copilot and [team chat](/building/collaboration) serve different purposes:

| | Copilot | Team Chat |
|---|---------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | AI assistant for users | Human-to-human messaging |
| **Powered by** | AI agent | Weavy collaboration |
| **Responds** | AI with data access | Other team members |
| **Best for** | Questions, lookups, guidance | Discussions, decisions, updates |
| **Data access** | Queries app data via functions | No direct data access |

<Tip>
You can have both on the same page. Use team chat for human collaboration and the copilot for AI-assisted data lookups and guidance.
</Tip>

## Full end-to-end example

Here's a complete prompt that builds an app, creates an agent, and adds a copilot:

```text
Build a CRM with:
- Companies (name, industry, size)
- Contacts (name, email, phone, linked to company)
- Deals (name, amount, status, linked to company and contact)
- Dashboard with pipeline value and deals by status chart

Create an AI agent called "Sales Coach" that:
- Helps reps find deals and contacts
- Can query all CRM data
- Uses a friendly, encouraging tone
- Has conversation starters:
  "Show my open deals"
  "Deals closing this month"
  "Find contacts at a company"
  "Pipeline summary"

Add the Sales Coach copilot to the deals page.
```

This single prompt creates the entire app, the AI agent with data access, and embeds the copilot on the deals page.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Place copilots where users need help">
    Put the copilot on pages where users are likely to have questions or need to look up data. A deals page copilot is more useful than one on a simple settings page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match agent to page context">
    If you have multiple copilots, use agents that are relevant to each page. A sales agent on the deals page, a support agent on the tickets page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use conversation starters to guide discovery">
    Good conversation starters show users what the copilot can do. Include starters that demonstrate the agent's key capabilities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combine with other features">
    Copilots work alongside team chat, kanban boards, dashboards, and other features. They add AI capability without replacing existing collaboration tools.
