## What is Gainable?

Gainable is an AI-powered platform that builds real, functional web applications from your descriptions. Tell us what you want to build, and our AI agents will create a complete app with a database, user interface, and all the features you need.

**No coding required.** Just describe what you want in plain English.

## How it works

When you describe what you want to build, Gainable's AI agents work together to create your app:

1. **You describe your app** - Write what you want in plain English
2. **AI plans the build** - Our Planner Agent breaks down your request
3. **AI generates code** - Our Build Agent creates your entire application
4. **Your app is ready** - Start using it immediately

<Info>
Every app you build includes a database, a modern user interface, and is ready to use right away. You can continue to iterate and add features by simply describing what you want to change.
