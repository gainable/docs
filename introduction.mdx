## What is Gainable?

Gainable is a no-code platform that lets non-technical teams build custom internal tools, dashboards, and workflows in minutes. Describe what you need in plain English and our AI agents will create a complete, working application — connected to your live business data.

**No coding required.** No engineering backlog. No $50K contracts. Just describe what you want and start using it.

## How it works

When you describe what you want to build, Gainable's AI agents work together to create your app:

1. **You describe your app** - Write what you want in plain English
2. **AI plans the build** - Our Planner Agent breaks down your request
3. **AI generates code** - Our Build Agent creates your entire application
4. **Your app is ready** - Start using it immediately

<Info>
Every app you build includes a database, a modern user interface, and is ready to use right away. You can continue to iterate and add features by simply describing what you want to change.
