## Create your first app

Let's build a simple deal tracker to see Gainable in action. This will take about 5 minutes.

### Step 1: Start a new project

1. Go to [build.gainable.dev](https://build.gainable.dev)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Give your project a name (e.g., "My Deal Tracker")

### Step 2: Describe what you want

In the chat interface, type your first prompt:

<CodeGroup>
```text Good prompt
Build a deal tracker with:
- Deal name, company, and amount
- Status (new, in progress, won, lost)
- A dashboard showing total deal value and a chart of deals by status
```

```text What this creates
- A Deal data model with all your fields
- A deals page with a table to manage deals
- Add, edit, and delete functionality
- A dashboard with KPI cards and a pie chart
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Being specific about your fields (like "deal name, company, and amount") helps Gainable create exactly what you need.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Watch it build

Gainable will show you a plan of what it's going to build, then generate your entire application. You'll see:

1. **Plan preview** - What features will be created
2. **Live progress** - Watch files being generated
3. **Your app** - A working application appears in the preview

### Step 4: Use your app

Once the build completes, you can:

- **Add a deal** - Click the "Add Deal" button and fill in the form
- **View your dashboard** - See your data visualized in charts
- **Edit or delete** - Click on any deal to modify it

<Note>
Your app updates in real-time. If you add a deal, the dashboard chart updates automatically.
</Note>

## Try adding a feature

Now let's add something new. In the chat, type:

```text
Add a kanban board view where I can drag deals between status columns
```

Gainable will add a kanban board to your existing app, preserving everything you've already built.

## Tips for success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about your data">
    Instead of "track customers", say "track customers with name, email, company, and signup date"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Describe relationships">
    If things are connected, say so: "each project has many tasks" or "contacts belong to companies"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Iterate incrementally">
    Start simple and add features one at a time. Don't try to build everything in one prompt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request features by name">
    Ask for specific features: "add a pie chart", "add a kanban board", "add real-time updates"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
