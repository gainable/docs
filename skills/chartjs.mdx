## Overview

Gainable apps include Chart.js for data visualization. You can add charts to any page by describing what you want to see.

## Chart types

### Line charts

Best for showing trends over time.

```text
"Add a line chart showing sales per month"
"Display order count over the last 12 months"
"Show revenue trend as a line graph"
```

### Bar charts

Best for comparing categories.

```text
"Add a bar chart comparing sales by region"
"Show deals closed by salesperson"
"Display monthly revenue as bars"
```

### Pie charts

Best for showing proportions.

```text
"Add a pie chart showing deals by status"
"Display tasks by priority as a pie chart"
"Show revenue breakdown by product category"
```

### Doughnut charts

Similar to pie charts with a hole in the center.

```text
"Add a doughnut chart for expense categories"
"Show completion status as a doughnut"
```

## Requesting charts

### Be specific about the data

<CodeGroup>

```text Good
"Add a pie chart showing deals grouped by status (won, lost, pending)"
```


```text Vague
"Add a chart"
```

</CodeGroup>

### Specify the chart type

<CodeGroup>

```text Good
"Add a line chart showing monthly revenue"
```


```text Ambiguous
"Show monthly revenue"
```

</CodeGroup>

### Name your metrics

<CodeGroup>

```text Good
"Dashboard with:
- Total deals (count)
- Pipeline value (sum of amounts)
- Deals by status (pie chart)
- Revenue by month (line chart)"
```


```text Incomplete
"Dashboard with some charts"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Common patterns

### Dashboard with KPIs and charts

```text
"Add a dashboard showing:
- Total deals count (KPI card)
- Total pipeline value (KPI card)
- Average deal size (KPI card)
- Deals by status (pie chart)
- Deals closed per month (line chart)
- Top 5 deals by amount (table)"
```

### Charts on detail pages

```text
"On the company detail page, add:
- Deals by status for this company (pie chart)
- Monthly revenue from this company (line chart)"
```

### Comparative charts

```text
"Add a bar chart comparing:
- Deals by salesperson
- Revenue by product
- Orders by region"
```

## Date-based charts

When charting data over time, specify the date field:

```text
"Line chart showing deals by close date per month"
"Bar chart of orders by order date"
```

<Tip>
  If your data has a business date (like close date or order date), specify it. Otherwise, charts will use the creation date.
</Tip>

## Interactive features

Charts in Gainable are interactive:

- **Hover** - See exact values
- **Click** - Filter or drill down (when configured)
- **Resize** - Responsive to container size
- **Animate** - Smooth transitions on data change

## Real-time updates

Charts update automatically when data changes:

- New records are added to the chart
- Updated values refresh the visualization
- Deleted records are removed
- All without page refresh

## Chart placement

### On dashboards

```text
"Dashboard with a pie chart on the left and line chart on the right"
```

### In cards

```text
"Show the status distribution chart in a card"
```

### With data tables

```text
"Above the deals table, show a chart of deals by status"
```

## Customization

### Colors

```text
"Use green for won deals, red for lost, yellow for pending"
"Use the theme colors for the chart"
```

### Labels

```text
"Show percentages on the pie chart"
"Include data values on the bars"
```

### Legends

```text
"Put the legend below the chart"
"Hide the legend" (for simple charts)
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match chart type to data">
    - **Trends over time** → Line chart
    - **Category comparison** → Bar chart
    - **Part of whole** → Pie or doughnut
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't overcrowd">
    Limit pie charts to 5-7 segments. Use bar charts for more categories.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use meaningful titles">
    "Deals by Status" is clearer than "Chart 1"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider the context">
    Place charts where they're relevant - sales charts on sales pages, etc.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Examples

### Sales dashboard

```text
Build a sales dashboard with:
- Total revenue (KPI card)
- Deal count (KPI card)
- Win rate (KPI card)
- Revenue by month (line chart)
- Deals by stage (pie chart)
- Top salespeople (bar chart)
```

### Project overview

```text
Add to the project dashboard:
- Tasks by status (doughnut chart)
