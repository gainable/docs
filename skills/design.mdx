## Requesting themes

### Direct theme request

```text
"Use the corporate theme"
"Apply dark mode"
```

### By description

```text
"Professional, corporate feel" → corporate or business
"Playful and fun" → cupcake or pastel
"Modern and techy" → cyberpunk or night
"Warm and cozy" → autumn or retro
"Premium look" → luxury or dark

```

<Tip>
If you describe a style like "professional" or "playful", Gainable will choose an appropriate theme automatically.
</Tip>

## Color customization

Beyond themes, you can request specific colors:

```text
"Use blue and gray colors"
"Make the primary color green"
"Use a purple accent color"
```

### Color contexts

|---------|----------------|
| Primary | Buttons, links, active states |
| Secondary | Secondary buttons, accents |
| Accent | Highlights, special elements |
| Neutral | Backgrounds, text |

## UI components

Gainable apps use DaisyUI components that adapt to your theme:

### Buttons

```text
"Primary action buttons"
"Outline style buttons"
"Ghost buttons for subtle actions"
```

### Cards

```text
"Cards with shadows"
"Bordered cards"
"Compact cards"
```

### Forms

```text
"Bordered input fields"
"Floating label inputs"
"Compact form layout"
```

### Navigation

```text
"Tab navigation"
"Sidebar navigation"
"Breadcrumb navigation"
```

## Layout requests

### Page structure

```text
"Sidebar on the left with main content on the right"
"Header at top, content below"
"Full-width layout"
```

### Content layout

```text
"Two-column layout"
"Grid of cards"
"Stacked sections"
```

### Spacing

```text
"More padding around content"
"Compact layout"
"Spacious design"
```

## Responsive design

All Gainable apps are automatically responsive. The layout adjusts for:

- **Desktop**: Full sidebar, multi-column grids
- **Tablet**: Collapsible sidebar, adjusted columns
- **Mobile**: Single column, hamburger menu

You don't need to request this - it's built in.

## Common customizations

### Add a sidebar

```text
"Add a sidebar with navigation links to Dashboard, Deals, and Contacts"
```

### Style badges

```text
"Show priority as colored badges:
- High: red
- Medium: yellow
- Low: green"
```

### Card styling

```text
"Show deals as cards with shadows and hover effects"
```

### Table styling

```text
"Striped table rows"
"Compact table with smaller text"
"Bordered table cells"
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose one theme and stick with it">
    Consistency is better than mixing styles. Pick a theme that fits your purpose.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Let the theme do the work">
    Themes handle colors automatically. You don't need to specify colors for every element.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Describe the feel, not the pixels">
    "Professional and clean" works better than "use #1a1a1a with 16px padding"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider your users">
    Business apps → corporate themes. Fun apps → playful themes. Match user expectations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Examples

### Professional dashboard

```text
"Use the corporate theme.
Clean layout with:
- Sidebar navigation
- KPI cards at the top
- Charts below
- Professional, minimal design"
```

### Playful task app

```text
"Use the cupcake theme.
Friendly design with:
- Colorful status badges
- Card-based layout
- Fun, approachable feel"
```

### Dark mode app

```text
"Use dark mode.
Modern, sleek design with:
- High contrast text
- Subtle borders
- Glowing accent colors"
```

## Changing themes later

You can always update the theme:

```text
"Change the theme to dark mode"
"Switch to the forest theme"
"Make it look more professional"
```

The entire app updates to the new theme while keeping all your data and features.
