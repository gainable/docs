## Overview

Kanban boards let you visualize work as cards in columns. Drag cards between columns to update their status. Gainable makes it easy to add kanban boards to any app.

## Requesting a kanban board

Simply describe what you want:

```text
"Add a kanban board for tasks with columns: To Do, In Progress, Done"
"Show deals as a pipeline board"
"Create a task board where I can drag cards between columns"
```

## What you get

When you request a kanban board, Gainable creates:

- **Columns** based on your status options
- **Cards** for each item showing key information
- **Drag-and-drop** to move cards between columns
- **Real-time sync** so all users see changes
- **Column counts** showing how many items are in each column

## Defining columns

Columns typically correspond to status values. Be explicit:

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
"Kanban board with columns:
- Backlog
- In Progress
- Review
- Done"
```

```text Vague
"Add a kanban board"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Card content

Specify what information appears on each card:

```text
"Cards show:
- Task title
- Assignee name
- Due date
- Priority badge"
```

Default card content usually includes:
- Primary field (name/title)
- Status or category badge
- Key details (date, assignee, etc.)

## Common patterns

### Task board

```text
Build a task tracker with:
- Tasks: title, description, assignee, due date
- Status: to do, in progress, review, done

Add a kanban board where:
- Each column is a status
- Cards show title, assignee, and due date
- Dragging updates the task status
```

### Deal pipeline

```text
Build a CRM with:
- Deals: name, company, amount, stage
- Stages: lead, qualified, proposal, negotiation, closed

Show deals as a pipeline board where:
- Each column is a stage
- Cards show deal name, company, and amount
- Dragging moves the deal to that stage
```

### Hiring tracker

```text
Track candidates with:
- Name, position, source
- Status: applied, phone screen, interview, offer, hired

Kanban board with:
- Columns for each status
- Cards showing name and position
- Drag to advance candidates through the pipeline
```

## Customization

### Column colors

```text
"Color the columns:
- To Do: purple
- In Progress: blue
- Done: green"
```

### Column actions

```text
"Add a + button in each column header to create a new item in that status"
```

### Card actions

```text
"Click a card to open an edit modal"
"Add a delete button to cards"
```

### Sublabels

```text
"Show the total deal value in each column header"
"Display task count below each column name"
```

## Sorting within columns

By default, cards maintain their order. You can request ordering:

```text
"Sort cards by due date within each column"
"Order cards by priority (high first)"
"Let users drag to reorder cards within a column"
```

## Real-time updates

Kanban boards update in real-time:

- **Card moves** appear instantly for all users
- **New cards** show up when created
- **Edited cards** refresh with new content
- **Deleted cards** disappear

<Note>
When you drag a card, the change is saved immediately and all connected users see the move in real-time.
</Note>

## Filtering

Add filters to focus on specific cards:

```text
"Filter the board by assignee"
"Add a priority filter"
"Search cards by title"
```

## Multiple boards

You can have multiple kanban views:

```text
"One board for my tasks (filtered to my assignments)"
"Team board showing all tasks"
"Archive board for completed items"
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Limit columns to 4-7">
    Too many columns make the board hard to use. Combine similar statuses if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep card content concise">
    Show only essential info on cards. Details can go in a detail view on click.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use meaningful column names">
    "In Progress" is clearer than "Stage 2"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider column colors">
    Colors help users quickly identify stages. Green for done, yellow for in progress, etc.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Combining with other features

### Charts

```text
"Above the kanban board, show a bar chart of task counts by status"
```

### List view toggle

```text
"Let users switch between kanban view and list view"
```

### Filters

```text
"Add assignee and priority filters above the board"
```

## Example: Complete task board

```text
Build a task management app:

Tasks have:
- Title, description
- Status: backlog, to do, in progress, review, done
- Priority: low, medium, high
- Assignee (user)
- Due date

Show a kanban board where:
- Columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
- Column colors: gray, purple, blue, orange, green
- Cards show: title, priority badge, assignee avatar, due date
- Drag to move between columns
- Click card to edit details
- + button in each column header to add new task

Filters above the board:
- Filter by assignee
- Filter by priority
```
