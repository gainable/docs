## Placement patterns

### Page-level

Everyone on the page sees the same component:

```text
"Add a team chat to the dashboard"
```

### Item-level

Each item has its own instance:

```text
"Add chat to each project"
"Add files to each deal"
"Add comments to each task"
```

### Global

Accessible from anywhere:

```text
"Add a messenger accessible from all pages"
"Add notification bell in the header"
```

## Examples

### Project workspace

```text
Build a project manager with:
- Projects (name, status, description)
- Tasks for each project

On the project detail page, add:
- Team chat for project discussions
- File sharing for project documents
- Activity feed for updates
```

### CRM with collaboration

```text
Build a CRM with:
- Companies and contacts
- Deals linked to companies

On each deal page, add:
- Comments for internal notes
- Files for proposals and contracts
```

### Team dashboard

```text
Build a team dashboard with:
- Announcements feed
- Team chat
- Shared files area
- Notification bell in header
```

## Combining components

You can use multiple collaboration features together:

```text
"On the project page:
- Chat tab for discussions
- Files tab for documents
- Activity tab for updates
- Comments on individual tasks"
```

## Real-time behavior

All collaboration components are real-time:

- Messages appear instantly
- Files show immediately after upload
- Comments update live
- Notifications push automatically

## Notifications

Gainable handles notifications automatically:

- **Toast notifications** appear for new messages
- **Badge counts** show unread items
- **Notification center** collects all activity

Users receive notifications for:
- New messages in their chats
- @mentions in comments
- Replies to their posts
- File shares

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match component to use case">
    - **Chat**: Ongoing discussions
    - **Comments**: Item-specific feedback
    - **Files**: Document sharing
    - **Messenger**: Private conversations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Place contextually">
    Put chat on project pages for project discussions, not floating randomly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider scope">
    - Global chat can get noisy
    - Item-level chat stays focused
    - Choose based on your team size and use case
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't overload pages">
    Pick the collaboration features that make sense. Not every page needs chat, files, and comments.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Layout options

### Inline

Component appears directly on the page:

```text
"Show the chat in the main content area"
```

### Drawer

Component slides out from the side:

```text
"Open chat in a slide-out drawer"
"Show files in a right panel"
```

### Modal

Component appears in an overlay:

```text
"Open messenger in a modal"
```

### Tab

Component is one tab among several:

```text
"Tabs: Overview, Chat, Files, Comments"
```
