## What are real-time updates?

Real-time updates mean changes appear instantly for all users without refreshing the page. When someone adds a deal, updates a task, or deletes a contact, everyone sees the change immediately.

## How it works

Gainable apps use WebSocket connections to push updates:

1. **User A** creates a new task
2. **Server** saves the task to the database
3. **Server** broadcasts "new task created" to all connected users
4. **User B's screen** updates automatically to show the new task

<Note>
This happens in milliseconds - changes feel instantaneous.
</Note>

## What updates in real-time?

By default, these actions trigger real-time updates:

| Action | What happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **Create** | New item appears in lists and counts update |
| **Update** | Changed item refreshes with new values |
| **Delete** | Item disappears from all views |

This applies to:
- List views and tables
- Dashboard KPIs and charts
- Kanban board cards
- Detail views

## Requesting real-time features

Real-time is built into Gainable apps by default. To emphasize it:

```text
"Make sure the task list updates in real-time"
"Show live updates when deals change"
"Sync changes across all users instantly"
```

## Use cases

### Collaborative dashboards

Multiple team members viewing the same dashboard see updates as data changes:

- New deals added to pipeline
- Status changes on tasks
- KPI totals recalculating

### Kanban boards

When someone drags a card to a new column:

- All users see the card move
- Column counts update
- No page refresh needed

### Activity feeds

Real-time is especially useful for:

- Team activity logs
- Comment threads
- Notification counts

## What doesn't update in real-time

Some things require a page refresh:

- **Navigation changes** - New pages or routes added
- **Layout changes** - Structural modifications to the UI
- **Filter states** - Your current filter selections stay the same

## Performance considerations

Real-time updates are optimized for typical use:

- **Efficient updates** - Only changed data is sent
- **Smart rendering** - Only affected components re-render
- **Connection management** - Automatic reconnection if disconnected

<Tip>
Real-time works best for apps with moderate data volumes. For very large datasets (thousands of items), consider using filters to limit the displayed data.
</Tip>

## Combining with other features

Real-time updates work seamlessly with:

### Charts

```text
"Dashboard charts that update when new data is added"
```

Charts recalculate and animate when underlying data changes.

### Kanban boards

```text
"Kanban board where all users see cards move in real-time"
```

Drag-and-drop actions sync across all connected users.

### Collaboration

```text
"Team chat with real-time messages"
```

Messages appear instantly for all participants.

## Troubleshooting

### Changes not appearing?

- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page once
- Ensure you're looking at the same data (filters, etc.)

### Updates seem delayed?

- High network latency can cause slight delays
- Large data changes may take a moment to process
- Complex views may have brief rendering delays
