## What are data connectors?

Data connectors let you bring data from external systems into your Gainable app. Instead of manually entering data, you connect a source — like a CRM, spreadsheet, or payment platform — and use a conversational AI agent to define how that data maps into your app's data models.

The **Data Model agent** walks you through the process: discovering available columns, letting you pick which ones to include, renaming fields, setting types, choosing primary keys, and syncing the data into your app.

<Info>
Data connectors are a build-time tool. You set them up while designing your app, and they sync external data into your data models. This is different from [copilot agents](/agents/copilot), which are runtime assistants that help your app's users.

## Supported data sources

| Source | Category | Auth | Capabilities |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| **HubSpot** | CRM | OAuth | Read & write contacts, companies, deals |
| **Folk CRM** | CRM | OAuth | Read & write CRM data |
| **Google Sheets** | Spreadsheet | OAuth | Read & write rows |
| **Stripe** | Payments | API key | Read customers, invoices, subscriptions |
| **Databricks** | Data warehouse | OAuth | Read catalogs, schemas, tables, run SQL |
| **Attio** | CRM | OAuth | Read & write CRM data |

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect a data source">
    Choose a connector and authenticate with OAuth or an API key. Gainable securely stores the connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a data model and link the source">
    Pick an existing data model (or create a new one) and link the connected source to it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent discovers available columns">
    The Data Model agent reads the external source and shows you the available columns along with sample data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chat to define your schema">
    Use natural language to select columns, rename fields, set types, and pick a primary key. The agent handles the mapping.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save schema and sync data">
    Confirm the schema and sync the data into your app. Records from the external source populate your data model.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Chatting with the Data Model agent

The Data Model agent understands natural language commands for shaping your schema. Here are some examples:

```text
Include first name, last name, email, and company name
```

```text
Rename "company_name" to "company" and "amt" to "amount"
```

```text
Set the email field as the primary key
```

```text
Change the "amount" field type to currency
```

```text
Exclude the internal_id and legacy_status columns
```

```text
Show me a preview of the data with these columns
```

The agent will confirm each change and show you an updated preview so you can verify the schema before syncing.

## Merging multiple sources

You can connect multiple data sources to a single data model. This is useful when the same type of data lives in different systems — for example, contacts in both HubSpot and Folk CRM.

### How merging works

1. **Connect each source** to the same data model
2. **Define a merge key** — a shared field (like email) used to match records across sources
3. **Set source priority** — choose which source takes precedence when the same field has different values
4. **Resolve conflicts** — the higher-priority source wins for overlapping fields; unique fields from each source are always included

<Accordion title="Example: Merging contacts from HubSpot and Google Sheets">
You have contacts in HubSpot (with deal history) and a Google Sheet (with custom scoring). Both share an email column.

1. Connect HubSpot and Google Sheets to your **Contacts** data model
2. Set **email** as the merge key
3. Set HubSpot as the primary source (higher priority)
4. After sync, each contact has deal data from HubSpot and scoring from Google Sheets — matched by email

If both sources have a "company" field with different values, HubSpot's value is used because it has higher priority.
</Accordion>

## Managing connections

The data connector interface has three main areas:

- **Connections tab** — View all connected sources, add new connections, or disconnect existing ones
- **Schema tab** — See and edit the field mappings between external columns and your data model fields
- **Preview tab** — View sample data with your current schema applied before committing a sync

Use the **Sync** button to pull the latest data from connected sources into your app.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always set a primary key">
    Choose a unique field (like email or ID) as the primary key. This ensures records are correctly identified during syncs and merges, preventing duplicates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start with one source">
    Connect and configure a single data source first. Once you're happy with the schema and the data looks right, add additional sources and configure merging.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep schemas focused">
    Only include the columns your app actually needs. Importing every available field adds noise and makes your data models harder to work with.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test with preview before syncing">
    Always check the Preview tab before running a full sync. This lets you catch mapping issues, unexpected nulls, or type mismatches before they reach your app data.
