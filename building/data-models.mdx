## Understanding data in Gainable

When you describe data in your prompts, Gainable creates **data models** - structured definitions of what information your app stores. Think of a data model as a template for each type of thing you're tracking.

## What is a data model?

A data model defines:
- **What fields** each item has (name, email, status, etc.)
- **What type** each field is (text, number, date, etc.)
- **How items relate** to other items (belongs to, has many)

<Accordion title="Example: Deal model">
When you say "track deals with name, amount, and status", Gainable creates a Deal model:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| name | Text | The deal name |
| amount | Number | The deal value |
| status | Options | Selected from predefined choices |
| createdAt | Date | Automatically added |
| updatedAt | Date | Automatically added |
</Accordion>

## Collection types

The **Data** tab in your app groups collections into three categories:

| Aspect | App Collections | Data Collections | Core Collections |
|--------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Source | Created in your app | Synced from external sources | Built-in system models |
| Editable | Yes | Read-only (managed via data connectors) | Read-only |
| Examples | companies, deals, tasks | HubSpot contacts, Google Sheets rows | users, agents, connections |
| Chat enabled | Yes | No | No |

### App Collections

Custom collections created when you describe data models. Fully editable and specific to your app — these are what you build.

### Data Collections

External data synced via [data connectors](/building/data-connectors) (HubSpot, Sheets, Stripe, etc.). They appear automatically when you attach a data model. Read-only from the app — managed through the data connectors interface.

### Core Collections

Built-in system collections present in every app: users, agents, email templates, email logs, user field metadata, and connections. Read-only, managed by the platform.

## Field types

When describing your data, you can specify field types to get exactly what you need:

### Text fields

For names, descriptions, and other text content.

```text
Prompt: "title (text)" or just "title"
Stores: Any text content
Example: "Enterprise License Renewal"
```

### Number fields

For quantities, amounts, and measurements.

```text
Prompt: "quantity (number)" or "amount"
Stores: Numeric values
Example: 42, 3.14, 1000000
```

### Currency fields

For money values with proper formatting.

```text
Prompt: "price (currency)" or "amount in dollars"
Stores: Numeric value
Displays: $1,234.56
```

### Date fields

For dates and timestamps.

```text
Prompt: "due date" or "created date"
Stores: Date and time
Displays: Formatted date
```

### Option fields (Enums)

For selecting from a predefined list.

```text
Prompt: "status (new, in progress, done)"
Stores: One of the specified options
Displays: Dropdown or badges
```

### Yes/No fields (Boolean)

For true/false values.

```text
Prompt: "is active (yes/no)" or "completed (checkbox)"
Stores: True or false
Displays: Checkbox or toggle
```

### Reference fields

For linking to other data models.

```text
Prompt: "assigned to (user)" or "belongs to company"
Stores: Link to another item
Displays: Name or selector
```

## Relationships between data

### One-to-Many

One item has multiple related items.

```text
"Each project has many tasks"
"Tasks belong to a project"
```

This creates:
- Project model (parent)
- Task model with a "project" field linking to Project

### Many-to-One

Multiple items link to one item.

```text
"Contacts belong to a company"
"Deals are linked to a contact"
```

### Self-referential

Items that reference the same type.

```text
"Each employee has a manager (another employee)"
"Tasks can have subtasks"
```

## Automatic fields

Every data model automatically includes:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `_id` | Unique identifier for each item |
| `createdAt` | When the item was created |
| `updatedAt` | When the item was last modified |

You don't need to ask for these - they're always there.

## Best practices

### Be explicit about fields

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Build a contact manager with:
- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Company
- Job title
- Notes
```

```text Vague
Build a contact manager
```
</CodeGroup>

### Specify options for status fields

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Status options: draft, pending, approved, rejected
```

```text Vague
Add a status field
```
</CodeGroup>

### Name relationships clearly

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Each task belongs to one project
Each project has many tasks
Tasks can be assigned to one user
```

```text Confusing
Tasks, projects, and users are related
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use meaningful field names

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
closeDate, expectedRevenue, primaryContact
```

```text Confusing
date1, field2, ref
```
</CodeGroup>

## Viewing your data

Once your app is built, you can:

- **See all items** in list views
- **Add new items** through forms
- **Edit items** by clicking on them
- **Delete items** with confirmation
- **Filter and search** to find specific items

## Data persistence

All data in Gainable apps is:

- **Automatically saved** when you create or edit items
- **Persistent** across sessions and users
- **Backed up** regularly
- **Accessible** via API endpoints

<Note>
You don't need to worry about "saving" - data is stored as soon as you submit a form or complete an action.
