**Copilot vs team chat:** The copilot is an AI assistant powered by an [AI agent](/agents/overview) — it responds with data lookups and knowledge-based answers. Team chat is human-to-human messaging. You can use both on the same page.

## Where to place collaboration

You can add collaboration features to specific contexts:

```

Everyone on that page sees the same chat.

### Item-level chat

```text
"Add a chat for each project"
```

Each project has its own separate conversation.

### Global messaging

```

Users can access direct messages from any page.

<Note>
Notifications are enabled by default. Users can manage their preferences.
