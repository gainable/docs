## Understanding views

Views are the pages and screens in your application. When you describe what you want to see, Gainable creates views that display your data and allow interaction.

## Types of views

### List views

Display multiple items in a table or card layout.

```text
"Show all deals in a list"
"Display tasks as cards"
"Create a table of contacts"
```

Features typically included:
- Column headers or card titles
- Sorting options
- Pagination for large lists
- Click to view/edit details

### Detail views

Show all information for a single item.

```text
"When I click a deal, show all its details"
"Project detail page with tasks"
```

Features typically included:
- All fields displayed
- Edit functionality
- Related items (if applicable)
- Delete option

### Dashboard views

Overview of data with summaries and charts.

```text
"Dashboard showing deal totals and charts"
"Overview page with KPIs"
```

Features typically included:
- KPI cards with totals
- Charts and graphs
- Recent activity
- Quick actions

### Kanban views

Cards organized in columns for workflow management.

```text
"Kanban board for tasks by status"
"Pipeline view for deals"
```

Features typically included:
- Drag-and-drop between columns
- Card summaries
- Column totals
- Quick edit

## UI components

Gainable uses a variety of components to build your interfaces:

### Cards

Compact display of item information.

```text
"Show deals as cards with name, amount, and status"
```

### Tables

Structured rows and columns for data.

```text
"Display contacts in a table with sortable columns"
```

### Forms

Input fields for creating and editing data.

```text
"Add deal form with all fields"
"Edit contact modal"
```

### Modals and drawers

Overlay panels for focused interactions.

```text
"Open edit form in a modal"
"Show details in a slide-out drawer"
```

### Filters

Narrow down displayed data.

```text
"Filter deals by status"
"Search contacts by name"
"Date range filter for orders"
```

### Charts

Visual data representation.

```text
"Pie chart of deals by status"
"Line chart showing monthly revenue"
```

## Responsive design

All Gainable views are automatically responsive:

- **Desktop**: Full layout with sidebars and multi-column grids
- **Tablet**: Adapted layout with collapsible elements
- **Mobile**: Single-column layout with touch-friendly controls

You don't need to specify this - it's built in.

## Navigation

Gainable creates navigation between views automatically:

- **Header navigation** for main pages
- **Breadcrumbs** for hierarchical navigation
- **Links** between related items
- **Back buttons** for returning to lists

### Requesting specific navigation

```text
"Add a sidebar with links to Dashboard, Deals, and Contacts"
"Put navigation tabs at the top"
```

## Customizing views

### Layout requests

```text
"Put the chart on the left and the list on the right"
"Stack the KPI cards horizontally"
"Use a two-column layout for the form"
```

### Placement requests

```text
"Add the filter above the table"
"Put the add button in the top right"
"Show the total at the bottom of the list"
```

### Display requests

```text
"Show the status as a colored badge"
"Display amounts in green for positive, red for negative"
"Use avatars for user assignments"
```
